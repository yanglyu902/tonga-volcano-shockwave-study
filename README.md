# tonga-volcano-shockwave-study

We visualize the propagation of the Tonga volcano shockwave throughout the U.S. using airport air pressure data. 

Content: 
- get_data.py: downloading data from the ASOS website. 
- analysis.ipynb: experimentations for data processing and visualization.
- multiple-shockwaves.ipynb: generate animations for multiple wavefronts given a time window.
- data/ and data/raw_data/: stores airport locations data and raw measurements.
- data_animation/: stores generated png files.

This work is inspired by a homework in AY 250 at UC Berkeley: https://github.com/profjsb/python-seminar. 

An example animation is the following:
